# Ship iOS v1.0 as Full Vertical Slice

## Context

iOS shell is already in place ([FR-IOS-SHELL](../requirements.md#318-fr-ios-shell) closed: Capacitor 8, WKWebView, UIScene, safe-area, splash, code-split). Nine remaining iOS-scoped FRs are open in [SRS](../requirements.md): App Store readiness, native UX, storage migration, polish, CI/CD, freemium gate, IAP, paywall, iCloud sync. The user requires v1.0 to land as one fully-featured release rather than a multi-stage rollout. Decision scope is iOS only — Android (FR-ANDROID-*) is parallel and out of scope here.

## Alternatives

- **Submit-First (publishable minimum)** — only [FR-IOS-APPSTORE](../requirements.md#319-fr-ios-appstore) + [FR-IOS-CICD](../requirements.md#323-fr-ios-cicd); all 8 lessons free; defer IAP/sync/polish to v1.1.
  - Pros: fastest TestFlight (1–2 wk); minimal review surface; pipeline validated before IAP complexity.
  - Cons: violates SRS freemium vision; bait-and-switch risk on later paywall introduction; second submission still needs IAP review.
  - Rejected because: ships a product that contradicts the SRS monetization model, with high refactor cost when paywall is retrofitted onto the published UX.

- **Monetize-First (SRS as designed)** — Submit-First scope **+** [FR-FREEMIUM](../requirements.md#324-fr-freemium) + [FR-IAP](../requirements.md#325-fr-iap) + [FR-PAYWALL](../requirements.md#326-fr-paywall) + [FR-IOS-STORAGE](../requirements.md#321-fr-ios-storage) + [FR-IOS-UX](../requirements.md#320-fr-ios-ux). Defer [FR-IOS-POLISH](../requirements.md#322-fr-ios-polish) and [FR-SYNC-PAID](../requirements.md#330-fr-sync-paid) to v1.1.
  - Pros: matches SRS exactly; one submission covers freemium; no UX deprecation cycle.
  - Cons: 4–6 wk; sandbox IAP debugging; ≥1 reject cycle on guideline 3.1.1 (Restore Purchases) likely.
  - Rejected because: still ships without sync, leaving Pro users on iOS without a key paid benefit advertised on the paywall.

- **Polish-Then-Monetize (beta → release)** — TestFlight beta with native polish + storage; App Store release adds freemium/IAP/paywall after beta.
  - Pros: real-device UX feedback before paywall; storage migration battle-tested.
  - Cons: two submissions; testers anchored on "free everything"; CI matrix grows; risk of indefinite paywall delay.
  - Rejected because: doubles submission overhead and trains testers to expect free L4–L8.

- **Full Vertical Slice (CHOSEN)** — Monetize-First scope **+** [FR-IOS-POLISH](../requirements.md#322-fr-ios-polish) **+** [FR-SYNC-PAID](../requirements.md#330-fr-sync-paid) (iOS half: iCloud KVS only). Single submission covering all 9 open iOS FRs.
  - Pros: SRS fully realized in one release; sync available day 1 for Pro; no "v1.1 to fix freemium" refactor; richest store listing.
  - Cons: 6–10 wk; custom Capacitor iCloud KVS plugin is the largest engineering unknown; KVS quotas (1 MB / 1024 keys) need verification against 200-session history; crash-reporting SDK adds PrivacyInfo entries.
  - Risks: solo-developer schedule slippage; KVS plugin authoring friction; App Review IAP rejection cycles.

## Decision

Ship a single iOS v1.0 covering all nine open iOS FRs (App Store assets, native UX, storage migration, polish, CI/CD, freemium tier model, RevenueCat IAP, paywall, iCloud KVS sync). Web build remains unchanged and platform-agnostic; gating is mobile-only via build-time `VITE_PLATFORM` flag. Android is tracked separately and is not blocked by, nor a blocker of, this ADR.

## Consequences

- **Largest scope** of any release to date; expect 6–10 weeks of focused work before App Store submission.
- **Custom Capacitor plugin** authored under `ios/App/App/Plugins/ICloudKVS.swift` adds a new code surface to maintain (Swift + JS bridge).
- **`VITE_PLATFORM` build flag** introduced; web/iOS bundles diverge in code paths (gate, IAP, sync) but share UI.
- **PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy** required: `UserDefaults` (CA92.1), Sentry SDK reasons, RevenueCat SDK reasons (network for receipts), iCloud KVS reasons.
- **Apple Developer account ($99/yr)** is a hard prerequisite; Bundle ID `dev.korchasa.bgtrainer` must be registered before signing.
- **RevenueCat dashboard + ASC product `bgtrainer_pro_lifetime`** must be created before sandbox testing; both are external services with their own setup latency.
- **SRS unchanged** structurally — every DoD item maps to an existing acceptance bullet already in [requirements.md](../requirements.md). No new FR-IDs are introduced.
- **No tests** in the project today; verification leans on `npm run build`, `xcodebuild`, file/grep checks, and manual reviewer (`korchasa`) for store-policy and on-device items.
- **Android (FR-ANDROID-*, FR-SYNC-PAID Android half)** stays open; this ADR does NOT close them.
- **iCloud KVS quota risk**: history can grow to 200 sessions × ~200 B = ~40 KB JSON, well under 1 MB; mastery + pace + lang together < 50 KB. Acceptable headroom but verified empirically (see DoD).
- **Default sub-decisions baked in**: drop iPad (`TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY = "1"`); opt out of dark mode (`UIUserInterfaceStyle = Light`); use Sentry for crash reporting (lighter than Firebase Crashlytics, easier sourcemap upload).

## Definition of Done

> Notation: each item lists its FR, the verification method (Test / Benchmark / `manual — <reviewer>`), and an Evidence command that should pass iff the item is done. Project has no automated test suite; most items use `manual — korchasa` or build/grep commands.

## Solution

Phased delivery within a single v1.0 release. Each phase ends with a green `npm run build` and (where applicable) a successful `cap sync ios` + Xcode build on simulator.

### Phase 1 — Foundation (data + flag) [~3 days]

1. Add `tier: "free" | "pro"` to `Lesson` type in [src/types.ts](../../src/types.ts); set L1–L3 `free`, L4–L8 `pro` in [src/data/lessons.ts](../../src/data/lessons.ts).
2. Introduce `VITE_PLATFORM=web|ios|android` env var:
   - Declare in [vite.config.ts](../../vite.config.ts) with `define` and TS ambient typing in `src/vite-env.d.ts`.
   - Default `web` for `npm run dev|build`; set `VITE_PLATFORM=ios` inside `build:ios` script.
3. Helper `src/utils/platform.ts` exporting `IS_WEB`, `IS_IOS`, `IS_NATIVE`.
4. Verify: `VITE_PLATFORM=ios npm run build && VITE_PLATFORM=web npm run build` both succeed, bundle diff inspectable via `dist/` size.

### Phase 2 — Storage adapter + migration [~5 days]

1. `npm i @capacitor/preferences@^8`.
2. Create `src/utils/storage.ts` with unified async API (`get(key)`, `set(key, value)`, `remove(key)`). Web branch wraps `localStorage`; native branch wraps `Preferences`.
3. Refactor [src/utils/history.ts](../../src/utils/history.ts), `src/utils/mastery.ts`, `src/utils/pace.ts`, `src/utils/lang.ts` to call the adapter (becomes async).
4. **App-shell loading state**: `App.tsx` adds `bootReady: boolean` flag; renders the inline HTML splash (already in `index.html`) until `useEffect` finishes initial state hydration via the adapter, then sets `bootReady=true` and mounts the lessons screen. Prevents flicker / empty-state flash on first paint.
5. **Idempotent migration** (`src/utils/migrate.ts`):
   - For each of 4 legacy keys: read both `localStorage[k]` and `Preferences.get(k)`.
   - If only legacy → copy → set `Preferences.set("__migrated__:k", "1")` → delete legacy.
   - If both → trust Preferences (newer); delete legacy.
   - If neither or only Preferences → no-op.
   - Migration safe to re-run; partial runs converge.
6. Verify on simulator: seed legacy localStorage, relaunch, confirm Preferences populated, legacy keys gone, second relaunch is no-op (no errors in console).

### Phase 3 — Native UX [~4 days]

1. `npm i @capacitor/splash-screen@^8 @capacitor/status-bar@^8 @capacitor/haptics@^8` then `npx cap sync ios`.
2. Configure splash in `capacitor.config.ts` (`backgroundColor: "#111111"`, `showSpinner: false`); call `SplashScreen.hide()` in `main.tsx` after first paint.
3. Status bar: in App init, `StatusBar.setStyle({ style: Style.Dark })` to match `#111111` background.
4. Haptics: in [src/hooks/useGame.ts](../../src/hooks/useGame.ts), call `Haptics.impact({ style: ImpactStyle.Light })` on correct, `ImpactStyle.Medium` on wrong; on round completion, `Haptics.notification({ type: NotificationType.Success })`.
5. Self-host Inter: download Inter-Regular/Medium/SemiBold/Bold woff2 from rsms.me/inter into `public/fonts/`; add `@font-face` in [src/index.css](../../src/index.css); remove any Google Fonts link from [index.html](../../index.html).
6. Back-swipe: simplest path — disable `allowsBackForwardNavigationGestures` via `capacitor.config.ts` `ios.allowsLinkPreview: false` + custom Swift in `CAPBridgeViewController` subclass; alternative is `window.history.pushState` per screen change in App.tsx.
7. `prefers-reduced-motion`: in `App.tsx` or engines, `window.matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)').matches` short-circuits any `setTimeout`-based auto-advance.

### Phase 4 — Freemium + IAP + Paywall [~7 days]

1. RevenueCat console: create project, public iOS API key, add `bgtrainer_pro_lifetime` non-consumable; in ASC create matching IAP product (tier 5, $4.99) with localized titles RU/UK/EN.
2. `npm i @revenuecat/purchases-capacitor` then `npx cap sync ios`.
3. New `src/services/iap.ts` with platform-conditional impl:
   - `IS_WEB` → stub returning `{ proUnlocked: true, packages: [] }`.
   - Native → wraps `Purchases.configure({ apiKey })`, `Purchases.getCustomerInfo()`, `Purchases.purchasePackage()`, `Purchases.restorePurchases()`.
4. Cache `proUnlocked` via storage adapter; offline-tolerant boot reads cache first, then refreshes from network.
5. Gate logic in [src/App.tsx](../../src/App.tsx) `handleLessonTap`: if `IS_NATIVE && lesson.tier === "pro" && !proUnlocked` → `setScreen("paywall")`, else current behavior.
6. New `src/components/screens/PaywallScreen.tsx`: localized strings in [src/i18n/strings.ts](../../src/i18n/strings.ts) (`paywallTitle`, `paywallBenefits`, `paywallBuy`, `paywallRestore`, `paywallEula`, `paywallPrivacy`); buy button shows `package.product.priceString`; Restore visible always; EULA + Privacy use Apple's standard `https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/` + project Privacy Policy URL.
7. Locked-tile UI in `src/components/screens/LessonsScreen.tsx`: when `IS_NATIVE && lesson.tier === "pro" && !proUnlocked`, render lock SVG + small price label; tap routes to paywall.
8. Register `paywall` in `Screen` type ([src/types.ts](../../src/types.ts)) and add case in `App.tsx` screen dispatch.

### Phase 5 — App Store readiness [~5 days]

> **Order note:** Sentry SDK (Phase 7) MUST be installed before this phase finalizes `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy`, because Sentry's bundled privacy manifest contributes API reasons to the merged report. Either move Sentry init forward into the start of Phase 5, or revisit the privacy report at the end of Phase 7 and re-archive. Default: install Sentry as step 0 of Phase 5.

0. **Install Sentry early**: `npm i @sentry/capacitor @sentry/react`; init in [src/main.tsx](../../src/main.tsx) gated by `import.meta.env.PROD && import.meta.env.VITE_SENTRY_DSN`. Defer release tagging + sourcemap upload to Phase 8 CI; this step only ensures the SDK's privacy manifest is part of the linked binary.
1. Generate AppIcon: design 1024×1024 PNG → use Bakery or `cordova-res` to expand into `AppIcon.appiconset` (18 entries).
2. Replace [LaunchScreen.storyboard](../../ios/App/App/Base.lproj/LaunchScreen.storyboard) with white-bg view (or `#111111` to match splash).
3. Author `ios/App/App/PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` listing API reasons (`NSPrivacyAccessedAPICategoryUserDefaults` → `CA92.1`); SDK list inherits from RevenueCat + Sentry bundled manifests at link time. Verify in Xcode → Build Settings → Privacy Report after archive.
4. Edit [Info.plist](../../ios/App/App/Info.plist):
   - `ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption = false`
   - `UISupportedInterfaceOrientations` = portrait only (and same for `~ipad` removed once iPad dropped)
   - `UIUserInterfaceStyle = Light` (Phase 6 polish, can stage now)
5. Apple Developer account: register Bundle ID `dev.korchasa.bgtrainer`, enable iCloud + In-App Purchase capabilities; configure automatic signing in Xcode → Signing & Capabilities.
6. Privacy Policy: short doc on github.io stating "no PII collected, all data local, IAP receipts handled by Apple, optional Sentry crash reports anonymized".
7. ASC listing: title "BG Trainer", subtitle, RU/UK/EN long descriptions, keywords (bulgarian, language, learning, grammar, drills), Education category, 4+ rating, support URL = github.io page.
8. Screenshots: capture 6.7" iPhone (15 Pro Max simulator, 1290×2796) of menu / lesson / pick game / round results / analytics.

### Phase 6 — iCloud KVS sync [~8–10 days]

1. Enable iCloud capability in Xcode (creates `App.entitlements` with `com.apple.developer.ubiquity-kvstore-identifier`).
2. Author custom Capacitor plugin in Swift:
   - `ios/App/App/Plugins/ICloudKVS.swift` — `@objc(ICloudKVSPlugin)` subclass `CAPPlugin` with `@objc func get/set/remove/sync(_ call: CAPPluginCall)` wrapping `NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore.default`.
   - Register listener `NSUbiquitousKeyValueStore.didChangeExternallyNotification` and forward to JS via `notifyListeners("change", payload)`.
   - JS side: `src/services/cloudKvs.ts` with `registerPlugin<ICloudKVSPlugin>("ICloudKVS")`.
3. Mirror layer `src/utils/cloudMirror.ts`: subscribed to storage-adapter writes; if `IS_IOS && proUnlocked && iCloudAvailable`, push the same key/value to KVS.
4. Boot reconciliation: on Pro-active launch, fetch all 4 keys from KVS; merge with local using rules from FR-SYNC-PAID (mastery max-lastTs, history dedup-by-ts, pace/lang LWW); persist merged state to storage adapter.
5. **Background flush (blocker)**: install `@capacitor/app`; subscribe to `appStateChange` / `pause`; on background event, await `ICloudKVS.sync()` to force-flush pending writes to iCloud before iOS suspends the process. Without this, kills/swipe-aways on device A lose unsynced data before device B can pull it.
6. Quota verification: write `scripts/measure-kvs-payload.mjs` that seeds 200-session history + full mastery and prints byte sizes; assert sum ≤ 800 KB; run as part of release checklist.

### Phase 7 — Polish [~3 days]

1. VoiceOver: add localized `aria-label` (drawn from `useI18n`, NOT hardcoded English) to `AnswerBtn`, `Progress`, `BackButton`, `NavHeader`. Then **manual rotor walkthrough on device** — open VoiceOver, swipe through one full game, confirm every interactive element is announced with the correct localized label. `grep aria-label` is a smoke test, not the verification.
2. Dynamic Type: audit `src/index.css` and Tailwind classes; ensure body uses `rem` units; root `font-size` already inherits from system. Replace any literal `text-[14px]` with `text-sm`.
3. Sentry release tagging: Sentry SDK was installed in Phase 5 step 0; here add `@sentry/vite-plugin` to inject release name + upload sourcemaps. CI environment variable `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` configured in Phase 8.

### Phase 8 — CI/CD [~4 days]

1. Create `.github/workflows/ios-release.yml`:
   - Trigger: `on: push: tags: ['v*']`.
   - Runner: `macos-14`.
   - Steps:
     1. `checkout`, `setup-node`, `npm ci`.
     2. **Keychain bootstrap** (signing import):
        ```sh
        security create-keychain -p "$KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD" build.keychain
        security default-keychain -s build.keychain
        security unlock-keychain -p "$KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD" build.keychain
        security set-keychain-settings -lut 21600 build.keychain
        echo "$IOS_CERT_P12_BASE64" | base64 -d > /tmp/cert.p12
        security import /tmp/cert.p12 -k build.keychain -P "$IOS_CERT_PASSWORD" -T /usr/bin/codesign
        security set-key-partition-list -S apple-tool:,apple:,codesign: -s -k "$KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD" build.keychain
        echo "$IOS_PROVISIONING_PROFILE_BASE64" | base64 -d > ~/Library/MobileDevice/Provisioning\ Profiles/profile.mobileprovision
        ```
     3. `npm run build:ios && npx cap sync ios`.
     4. `agvtool new-version -all $GITHUB_RUN_NUMBER`; `agvtool new-marketing-version "${GITHUB_REF_NAME#v}"`.
     5. `xcodebuild -workspace ios/App/App.xcworkspace -scheme App -configuration Release -archivePath build/App.xcarchive archive`.
     6. `xcodebuild -exportArchive -archivePath build/App.xcarchive -exportPath build -exportOptionsPlist ios/ExportOptions.plist`.
     7. `xcrun altool --upload-app -f build/App.ipa --type ios --apiKey "$ASC_KEY_ID" --apiIssuer "$ASC_ISSUER_ID"`.
2. Required secrets: `ASC_KEY_ID`, `ASC_ISSUER_ID`, `ASC_KEY_P8_BASE64`, `IOS_CERT_P12_BASE64`, `IOS_CERT_PASSWORD`, `IOS_PROVISIONING_PROFILE_BASE64`, `KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD`, `VITE_SENTRY_DSN`, `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`, `REVENUECAT_API_KEY_IOS`.
3. **First-tag smoke test**: tag `v0.1.0-alpha`, watch full workflow green, then open ASC → TestFlight and confirm the build appears (status "Processing" → "Ready to Test"). This is the real DoD signal — `gh run conclusion=success` alone is necessary but not sufficient.

### Phase 9 — Submission [~1–4 weeks calendar, mostly waiting]

1. TestFlight beta: invite 5–10 testers (sandbox IAP enabled by default in TestFlight); collect feedback for 1 week.
2. Submit for App Review with `What to test` / `App Review Information` filled (sandbox tester credentials, demo flow).
3. Iterate on rejections — most likely: Restore button visibility, EULA link, or PrivacyInfo gaps.
4. Release to App Store on approval.

### Verification at each phase

- `npm run build` exits 0.
- `npx cap sync ios` exits 0.
- Xcode → Product → Archive succeeds (Phases 5+).
- Smoke test on iPhone 15 Pro Max simulator after every phase: menu → lesson → game → results, no console errors.

## Follow-ups

- Android parity (FR-ANDROID-SHELL, FR-ANDROID-PLAYSTORE, FR-ANDROID-CICD, FR-SYNC-PAID Android half) — separate ADR, separate tagging.
- Localized App Store screenshots for additional languages beyond launch set.
- If KVS payload approaches quota, add per-session pruning beyond the existing 200-cap; benchmark should also vary mastery breadth (every L1–L8 item touched), not just session count.
- Custom EULA replacing Apple stdeula — important for clarifying lifetime non-consumable refund/family-sharing terms; not a v1.0 blocker since stdeula is App Review-acceptable.
- Revisit dark-mode opt-in once core CSS palette is theme-driven.
- Cross-platform IAP signature unification — addressed in the future Android ADR.
